# Snowflake End-to-End Data Engineering Project

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data engineering workflow using the Snowflake Cloud Data Warehouse Platform. It showcases how to architect, design, and implement a fully functional data pipeline from source to visualization.

## üìå Project Highlights

- Analyzed source data (Indian Air Quality Index) and evaluated architectural considerations for ingestion.
- Built a layered architecture including Stage, Raw, and Curated layers to manage data through its lifecycle.
- Ingested and processed real-time data effectively to support downstream consumption.
- Designed and implemented a complete data flow from ingestion to visualization.
- Created visual dashboards using Streamlit embedded within Snowflake for real-time insights.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Automation

The pipeline was automated using Snowpark Python along with GitHub Actions to establish a CI/CD workflow. This enabled continuous integration and deployment of all key processes including ingestion, transformation, and visualization without manual intervention.
